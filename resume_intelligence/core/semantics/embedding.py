# Purpose:
# Convert text or concepts into semantic vectors.

# This allows:
# Meaning-based comparison
# Domain independence
# Robust matching

# Examples
# “REST APIs” ≈ “Backend APIs”
# “BLoC” ≈ “MobX” (closer than random words)

# Important Rule
# Embedding is representation, not decision-making.
